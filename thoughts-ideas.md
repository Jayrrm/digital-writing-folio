# Thoughts and Ideas on Digital Writing

After reading *Taroko Gorge* and *First Screening*, I've had the idea at telling a story in prose style, that works as a kind of performance.

I had this idea because I enjoyed the way the words moved across the screen in *First Screening* and how it added to the meaning of the words, and added to the visualisation of what was written. The text itself was quite poetic, whereas I want to convert this to prose, if possible.

So, my idea is that you have, for example, a character on a train which might fall off a bridge. The text will slowly move across the page until the train falls, where the text then starts falling too. Another cool idea might be having a space themed story where the text moves appropriately depending on the direction of the plot.

Something I see online quite often is the use of punctuation and letters for creating images. It would be cool to perhaps interweave this kind of art with the story too, or use this as a separate idea altogether.
