#### ***What types of writing do you do?***

I write fantasy fiction, but used to do a lot of songwriting and poetry in high school. I've moved away from that a bit now, and am focusing on fantasy.

There was a point where I thought I wanted to write historical fiction, because I find history fascinating, but I've always found myself devouring fantasy, so this is what I've decided I want to write.

#### ***What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?***

I use MS Word, which I like particular because of the way the 'Styles' work. It allows me to navigate things more quickly, and create headings easily. This is particularly helpful when it comes to planning my writing, as a detailed, clear outline is something I need to write with relative ease.

Something I've discovered helps me write, because I like to write at night, is using dark mode so my eyes don't get so tired. The night light on my windows computer also helps reduce blue light, which I find very helpful.

Google Drive is a storage tool I use consistently on large projects, such as a novel, to back my work up regularly. I use this instead of OneDrive because I don't like how you cannot easily make space on one's laptop. Google Drive is easy because I can drop it all into a local folder, and it will update automatically online.

In terms of techniques, I find notebook writing particularly helpful when it comes to editing and idea generation. I like to break sentences down when editing to make them as neat and economical as possible, and quickly jot ideas down and solve problems on paper too. I find it a bit more portable this way, too, so no matter where I am, I can whip it out and get a few things down.

#### ***How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?***

As I mentioned above, all of these tools help me organise and find things with ease. This is absolutely necessary to me writing, because any impediment on my focus can mean I lose a rhythm I've found to the story.

One issue I sometimes find is that I have a lot of different documents that I save as a result of this organisation, which clogs up storage and makes things a bit messy. This hasn't been a big issue until now, but somewhere down the line if I need to trawl through different files to find a certain sentence or change, this will definitely end up being a problem.
