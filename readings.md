#### Scholars Contemplate the Irish Beer
In the description, this admits to be a rethink of Taroko Gorge, whereby it emulates the sky with words - a deep blue colour as the background and white text forming the poetry. It is about different scholars and poetsconsidering natural landscape with the background of alcohol (perhaps the cloud theme is a metaphor for consumption). The text, in hindsight, might have another way of reading it where the generation is a description of Irish beer's taste, using natural imagery to convey it.

Had trouble launching a number of programs before this one, because of Java, or limitations based on my laptop or OS. 

#### Everybody Dies
Seems to be an easier piece to navigate than Shade. Mainly because it lets you know where you can and can't move, and pushes you in certain directions a little more. Even so, I played this for an hour and couldn't navigate a way out of the bathroom where I'm supposed to clean toilets. The main problem I'm having with these games is when there seems to be no real plot or things to interact with. It makes it hard to figure out where to go, and makes it easy to lose patience. Still, I appreciate the illustrations and creativity with this piece.

#### First Screening
This is probably my favourite of the bunch. It tells what seems to be mini narratives with words as representations of objects. The words move across or up the screen to depict what is happening, and they occur one after the other automatically. I think I like the visual appeal of this, but also the opportunities it opens up. I am consitently wondering what will happen next.

I did also have a slight problem at one point with the program though, getting stuck on the 'tower' bit where it got stuck and didn't move on. THe video suggests it wasn't the end of the program, so may have to test this on a different browser or computer at one point.

#### Kissing the Steak (Chapter)
This explores three types of text generators and methods to go about them.

The first is **permutations**, which rearrange certain words in different orders, which look somewhat formualaic but indeed have different meanings. Any kind of repetition at the beginning of sentences or of words indicates a permutation generator.

The second is **slots** whereby a prestructured sentence has words substituted in specfiic spots by the computer, who randomly draws them from a word pool. Hence the name slots, the program automatically fills the slots allocated to its function.

#### Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading

This text looks at the different aesthetic values and functions of various modes of digital poetry.

A quote that has struck me as interesting: "To my mind, the poetics of this piece, its conceptualization and facilitation, are more important than the peotry it generates." This is said in reference to a piece whereby text inputed by other previous uses of the site is paired randomly with images users have also uploaded, which creates an amusing result. Often the pairings are oxymoronic, which make them sometimes funny, sometimes depressing. In this case, it's the idea and the way it's programmed that Memmott enjoys. "The *intertainment* is more potent than the entertainment."

I think it is also an interesting premise he explores: "literary hypermedia's redefnition of the enterprise of 'reading'".

He also explores the way digital poetry has changed not only the visual and auditory aspects of reading, but also "the performative/participatory, the computational and programmatic,".

Memmott writes about the struggles to classify digital poetry into categories, what he labels as "taxonomadic". Interestingly, he says that whilst this is often considered great by creatives, it is criticised by academics. He writes that academics should be receptive to this taxonomadism, as it is simply the way digital poetry functions and evolves. I wholeheartedly agree with Memmott on this, and it makes me consider what the productive purpose of categorising art such as digital writing is, unless to strip it of (some of) its originality.
