#### Scholars Contemplate the Irish Beer
In the description, this admits to be a rethink of Taroko Gorge, whereby it emulates teh sky with words - a deep blue colour as the background and white text forming the poetry. It is about different scholars and poetsconsidering natural landscape with the background of alcohol (perhaps the cloud theme is a metaphor for consumption). The text, in hindsight, might have another way of reading it where the generation is a description of Irish beer's taste, using natural imagery to convey it.

Had trouble launching a number of programs before this one, because of Java, or limitations based on my laptop or OS. 

#### Everybody Dies
Seems to be an easier piece to navigate than Shade. Mainly because it lets you know where you can and can't move, and pushes you in certain directions a little more. Even so, I played this for an hour and couldn't navigate a way out of the bathroom where I'm supposed to clean toilets. The main problem I'm having with these games is when there seems to be no real plot or things to interact with. It makes it hard to figure out where to go, and makes it easy to lose patience. Still, I appreciate the illustrations and creativity with this piece.

#### First Screening
This is probably my favourite of the bunch. It tells what seems to be mini narratives with words as representations of objects. The words move across or up the screen to depict what is happening, and they occur one after the other automatically. I think I like the visual appeal of this, but also the opportunities it opens up. I am consitently wondering what will happen next.

I did also have a slight problem at one point with the program though, getting stuck on the 'tower' bit where it got stuck and didn't move on. THe video suggests it wasn't the end of the program, so may have to test this on a different browser or computer at one point.
